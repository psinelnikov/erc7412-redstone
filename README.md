# RedStone ERC-7412 Foundry Example

This repository provides a comprehensive example of how to integrate [RedStone Oracles](https://redstone.finance/) into a smart contract using the [ERC-7412 standard](https://docs.redstone.finance/docs/smart-contract-devs/get-started/redstone-erc7412). The project uses a hybrid setup:

- **[Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/)** is used for compiling and deploying.
- **[Jest](https://jestjs.io/)** and **[Viem](https://viem.sh/)** are used for end-to-end testing of the oracle functionality, both locally with Anvil and on a live testnet.

## Project Structure

- `src/ETHFeed.sol`: A simple price feed contract that fetches the price of ETH using RedStone's ERC-7412 interface.
- `test/ETHFeed.test.ts`: Jest tests for local end-to-end validation. It deploys the contract to a local Anvil instance and verifies the oracle data fetching mechanism.
- `test/ETHFeed.garfield.test.ts`: Jest tests for interacting with a pre-deployed contract on the Garfield (Zircuit) testnet.
- `script/DeployETHFeed.s.sol`: A Foundry script for deploying the `ETHFeed` contract to any EVM-compatible chain.
- `foundry.toml`: Foundry configuration, including remappings for Node.js dependencies.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (v18 or later)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation)

## Getting Started

### 1. Installation

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/redstone-finance/erc7412-example
cd erc7412-example
bun install
```

### 2. Compile the Contract

Use Foundry to compile the smart contracts:

```bash
forge build
```

## Testing

This project includes two types of tests: local end-to-end tests and testnet interaction tests.

### Local End-to-End Testing

The local tests use Jest to deploy the `ETHFeed` contract to a temporary Anvil instance and verify that it can correctly fetch data from the RedStone oracle.

Run the tests with:

```bash
bun test
```

This command will automatically:
1. Start a local Anvil node.
2. Deploy the `ETHFeed` and `Multicall3` contracts.
3. Execute a transaction that uses the ERC-7412 mechanism to fetch the ETH price.
4. Verify that the price is correctly stored in the contract.

### Testnet Interaction (Garfield)

The `ETHFeed.garfield.test.ts` file is configured to interact with a pre-deployed contract on the Garfield testnet. To run it, you need to set up your environment.

1. Create a `.env` file by copying the example:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Add your private key to the `.env` file:

```
PRIVATE_KEY=0xYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY
```

3. Run the Garfield-specific test:

```bash
bun jest test/ETHFeed.garfield.test.ts
```

## Deployment

You can deploy the `ETHFeed` contract to any EVM-compatible chain using the provided Foundry script.

**1. Setup Private Key**

```bash
cast wallet import testnetKey --interactive
```

**2. Run the Deployment Script**:

```bash
forge script script/DeployETHFeed.s.sol \
     --rpc-url garfield_testnet \
     --account testnetKey \
     --broadcast -vv
   ```

This will deploy the `ETHFeed` contract and print its address to the console.

You can add this address to the `ETHFeed.garfield.test.ts` file to interact with it in the tests.

```
